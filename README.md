# US Bikeshare Data Analysis

## Overview
This Python script analyzes bike share data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Users can interactively explore data, apply time filters, and receive insights about bike share usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library

### Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```shell
   python bikeshare.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to specify your analysis:
   - Choose a city: Chicago, New York City, or Washington.
   - Select a time filter: by month, by day, or not at all.
   - If using the month filter, specify a month (e.g., January, February).
   - If using the day filter, specify a day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
   
3. The script will generate and display statistics based on your selections. You can also view raw data upon request.

### Example
- Choose "1" for Chicago as the city.
- Choose "1" for filtering by month.
- Select "2" for February.
- The script will provide statistics for bike share data in Chicago for February.
