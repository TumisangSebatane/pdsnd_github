# US Bikeshare Data Analysis

## Overview
This Python script analyzes bike share data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Users can interactively explore data, apply time filters, and receive insights about bike share usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library

### Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```shell
   python bikeshare.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to specify your analysis:
   - Choose a city: Chicago, New York City, or Washington.
   - Select a time filter: by month, by day, or not at all.
   - If using the month filter, specify a month (e.g., January, February).
   - If using the day filter, specify a day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
   
3. The script will generate and display statistics based on your selections. You can also view raw data upon request.

### Example
- Choose "1" for Chicago as the city.
- Choose "1" for filtering by month.
- Select "2" for February.
- The script will provide statistics for bike share data in Chicago for February.

# Revamped Changes 26 - 10 - 2023

Updates make the code easier to use and understand, enhancing the bike share data exploration experience.

### User-Friendly Input

   - The code now handles user input more gracefully. It's case-insensitive for city names and guides users through valid selections without errors.

### Streamlined Input Process

   - We've simplified how users interact with the code. A dedicated function ensures input is valid, making the code cleaner and more user-friendly.

### Added Features

   - The revamped code offers new options, including calculating the average trip duration, identifying popular starting stations, and breaking down user statistics (subscribers vs. customers).

### Enhanced Readability

   - We've made the code easier to understand. More comments and docstrings improve readability, especially for those who want to work with the code.

### User-Oriented Data Display

   - Users can now view raw data more conveniently, with the option to see it in small chunks and access additional statistics.
